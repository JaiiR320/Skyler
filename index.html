                I'm sitting here trying to come up with something witty and interesting to say, but for some reason
                all I can really think about is how much I wish you were here with me. Even though it has been over
                a month since we were last together, it feels like it was just yesterday that we were hanging out. 
                As much as I wish you were here, I am also glad to have been given the chance to get to know you a bit
                better as you are on IQP. Every moment apart makes me appreciate those two nights even more, and I cannot
                wait until you are back in Worcester.
